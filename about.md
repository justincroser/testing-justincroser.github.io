#### Detailed
Justin's heritage goes back in the 1940's to North and East Germany where family have been born and raised. He takes great pride in his heritage and sees himself more as a German-Australian than an Australian-German albeit being born in Australia. 

Justin is a vice-presidents member of his local SANFL club Woodville West-Torrens and spends his weekends at games unless he is working (up to 60hrs per week). In other down-time he spends with his family.

Justin has a vast degree of knowledge in information technology including but not limited too, system hardware and software, system administration, website design and ethical hacking. 

Justin has been fixing and building computers since the age of 10 and moved into consumer electronics at 15 starting to fix mobile devices. His first mobile device was an iPhone 3Gs in 2009 and successfully jailbroke it. He was a apple user full-time dabbling in android part-time including custom roms until 2024 and has since moved to android full-time.

An advocate of free speech, open source and open web standards Justin believes in helping others who are less fortunate and people who can't help themselves.

Justin has often been described as outspoken, confrontational, sharp-tongued,Â anti-establishment, straight edge, and iconoclastic.
