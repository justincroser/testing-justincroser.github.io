In short, No! You're thinking of Theistic Satanism also known as religious Satanism. I don't believe in angels, demons, god or the devil.

## So what exactly is LaVeyan Satanism?
Think of it as a form of "self-religion" or "self-spirituality" following life rules set out in the satanic bible a book by Anton LaVey in 1969. In the book it explains "The Nine Satanic Statements" and "The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth" more on that below. I've always felt calling it a bible was always a stupid idea.

## Quick FAQ
Q. Do you worship the devil?

A. No, we believe in oneself and that you control every aspect of your life that you are not a slave to some imaginable higher power.

Q. Do satanists sin?

A. As stated below in "The Nine Satanic Statements" we believe in self gratification and you make yourself happy and everyone else's gratification doesn't matter. I personally do what makes me happy and keeping my partner happy is one aspect of it, we aren't all selfish.

Q. Why is it called Satanism why not self-atheism?

A. Founder Anton LaVey embraced the iconography of Satan and the label of "Satanist" because it shocked people into thinking, and its association with social nonconformity and rebellion against the dominant system. When asked about the name of his religion, he replied that "the reason it's called Satanism is because it's fun, it's accurate and it's productive".

Q. Do you have any religious holidays?

A. After one's own birthday, the two major Satanic holidays are Walpurgisnacht and Halloween. Other holidays celebrated by members include the two solstices, the two equinoxes, and Yule however it's up to the individial to claim any/all the holidays.

## The Nine Satanic Sins
These "sins" outline characteristics Satanists should avoid:
1. Stupidity<br />
2. Pretentiousness<br />
3. Solipsism<br />

5. Herd Conformity<br />
6. Lack of Perspective<br />
7. Forgetfulness of Past Orthodoxies<br />
8. Counterproductive Pride<br />

## The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth
These outline the rules every single satanist should live by:

1. Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.
2. Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them.
3. When in another's home, show them respect or else do not go there.
4. If a guest in your home annoys you, treat them cruelly and without mercy.
5. Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.
6. Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and they cry out to be relieved.
7. Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained.
8. Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself.
9. Do not harm little children.
10. Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food.
11. When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask him to stop. If he does not stop, destroy him.
