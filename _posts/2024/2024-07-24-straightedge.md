Straight edge (sometimes abbreviated as sXe or signified by XXX or simply X) is a subculture of hardcore punk whose adherents refrain from using alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs in reaction to the punk subculture's excesses. Some adherents refrain from engaging in promiscuous or casual sex, follow a vegetarian or vegan diet and do not consume caffeine or prescription drugs. The term "straight edge" was adopted from the 1981 song "Straight Edge" by the hardcore punk band Minor Threat.

## What is International Edge Day?
National Edge Day is a celebration founded by people who live straight edge lifestyles. The occasion has been observed annually on October 17 since 1999. The inaugural event, originally called Edge Fest, was held in Boston, Massachusetts. It is most prominent in Boston, but annual events are now held by individuals in U.S. states such as Georgia and California, and globally in cities such as Gothenburg, São Paulo and London. In later years it has become a holiday for people who live straight edge lifestyles not just a yearly concert.
