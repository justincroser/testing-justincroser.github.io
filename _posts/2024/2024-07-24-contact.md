So you've decided to contact me and not for my podcast 😮‍💨 anyway... If you insist on contacting me the best methods of contact are:
1. Phone via Signal - you know most people just message these days.
2. Mastodon - this is where I mainly post on social media.
3. Email - availible from my linktree URL.

I do have normal social media but I barely use it and only have it for my podcast or snapchat streak for my missus she really loves that 500+ day streak 🤣 if you really want to know the nitty gritty on why I don't use mainstream social media go to the article named <a href="https://justincroser.com/privacy">privacy</a>.

NOTE: the email address provided on my linktree is rotated monthly to prevent spam. The linktree can be found on this page in the  `Written by:` section.
