# Meta is now uing user data in AI training
Anyone using Facebook or Instagram: you'll receive a notification about your data being used to train AIs. The opt out process is deliberately convoluted and you have to fill out a form to object. This is what I wrote in mine, and the objection was immediately registered as successful, so feel free to copy.

`I object to my data being used in training an Al. My photos are personal and contain images of my face associated with my name. This data could be used to generate deepfakes using my likeness if it is included in an Al data set. further object to my captions being used within this data set as these contain personal information which would not be appropriate to include.`

If you can't figure it out feel free to contact me I'll see if I can help. This is not a post on which you can contact me to fart out your opinions about Meta or AI or whatever. So don't. I'm sharing helpful info for people who need it and giving them actual help if needed, not for you to dribble whatever.
